# Robo API
This is a program I did for mass recovering and removal of resources using a Web API.
## TODO
* refactor methods to use the same abastract level.
* program doesn't check for failure on returning of GetAPI
* the method used to format file entries should be optional and parametrized
* parameters for the header should stored in generic form on config file and class
## Usage
1. create a text file list with ids
2. change application config file with parameters
3. run!
